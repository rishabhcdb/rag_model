# 📚 RAG Legal Document Question-Answering System
# Overview
A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for legal document analysis and question-answering. This system combines advanced document processing, hybrid retrieval strategies, and large language models to provide accurate, contextual answers to complex legal queries.

# 🎯 Key Capabilities
Legal Document Processing: Smart chunking optimized for legal document structure

Hybrid Retrieval: Ensemble of semantic similarity, MMR diversity, and BM25 keyword search

LLM Integration: LLaMA 3.1 8B model fine-tuned for legal question-answering

Interactive Frontend: Streamlit-based GUI for document upload and querying

Persistent History: SQLite database logging all interactions for audit and reference

# 🚀 Features
✅ Smart Document Chunking: Title-based semantic chunking preserves legal document structure

✅ Hybrid Ensemble Retrieval: Combines 3 retrieval methods for comprehensive context coverage

✅ Legal-Optimized Prompting: Engineered to extract facts, dates, amounts, and legal elements precisely

✅ Hallucination Prevention: Strict guidelines against generating unsupported legal facts

✅ Streamlit GUI: User-friendly interface with document upload and history tracking

✅ SQLite Logging: Persistent storage of all Q&A interactions with metadata

✅ Session Management: Clear session functionality for handling multiple documents

# 🏗️ Architecture
Document Processing Pipeline
text
PDF Input → Unstructured Partition → Title-Based Chunking → Metadata Filtering → Vector Store
PDF Partitioning: Uses unstructured library with high-resolution strategy and YOLOX model

Smart Chunking: chunk_by_title() with optimized parameters:

Max characters: 1,500

Overlap: 400 characters

Combine threshold: 75 characters

New chunk threshold: 1,200 characters

Retrieval System
text
Query → [Similarity Retriever, MMR Retriever, BM25 Retriever] → Ensemble → Context
Hybrid Ensemble Composition:

Similarity Retriever (50% weight): k=25, semantic vector similarity

MMR Retriever (30% weight): k=20, fetch_k=60, λ=0.5 for diversity

BM25 Retriever (20% weight): k=20, keyword-based retrieval

Embeddings & Vector Store
Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 (768-dimensional)

Vector Store: ChromaDB for efficient similarity search and persistence

Metadata Handling: Complex metadata filtering for LangChain compatibility

Language Model Integration
Model: Ollama LLaMA 3.1 8B (locally hosted)

Prompt Engineering: Specialized template for legal fact extraction

Output Parsing: Structured responses with bullet points and sections
